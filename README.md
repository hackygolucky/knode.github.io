===============

A resource for all things node.js.


As a local organizer, it would be wonderful to be more tied in to the direction of the larger Node.js community. There are many user groups that have expressed a need for help with resources, speakers, and guidance. Knode was started right after CascadiaJS after a number of Node organizers at the conference were talking about their struggles with local groups and how they'd love a sharing mechanism. By creating a portal that allows for user groups to help support each other, we will grow the community we hold dear.
