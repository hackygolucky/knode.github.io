# knode.github.io

A resource for all things node.js.


As a local organizer, it would be wonderful to be more tied in to the direction of the larger Node.js community. There are many user groups that have expressed a need for help with resources, speakers, and guidance. Knode was started right after CascadiaJS after a number of Node organizers at the conference were talking about their struggles with local groups and how they'd love a sharing mechanism. By creating a portal that allows for user groups to help support each other, we will grow the community we hold dear.


The More You Knode ¸.·´¯`★

Please file issues for what you'd love to see from Knode! Contributing documentation and roadmap coming SOON.

## developing

To develop locally, follow these steps:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This should open a local development server. It will automatically recompile on filesystem changes, so no need
to restart.
